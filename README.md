# 20-challenge
 Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. 


## Technology
This project uses the following libraries:


## Installation Guide
Using the Conda package manager: [My GitHub Project](https://github.com/ALovettII/19-challenge.git)

## Usage
### Background
1. To automate the creation of joint savings accounts:
    * you’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses.
        * addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. 

2. Smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account:
    * features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
    
### What You're Creating
1. The completed Solidity JointSavings smart contract.
2. A folder named Execution_Results that contains at least eight images.
    * These images should confirm that the deposit and withdrawal transactions, worked as expected:
        * designed to test the JointSavings functionality in the JavaScript VM

### Sections:
1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
2. Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM
3. Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract
